# Welcome to Zandercraft! ðŸ‘‹  
We work to create cool things through the power of code and to keep good projects alive! We are a group of YouTubers, developers, and gamers working to create cool applications and have fun while doing it!

## Retired Projects  
These projects have been removed due either to abandonment, a Zandercraft-maintained fork's original creator returning to their repo, or their usefulness reaching it's end.  
- Zandercraft/adarkroom (Originally forked and maintained for Vortek Academy - no longer needed)  
- Zandercraft/Texter-Revived (Was abandoned by original developer, but active development has resumed)  
- Zandercraft/TechnicSolder (Maintained at ZandercraftGames/TechnicSolder for the time being)
